A real-time object detection system using the YOLOv8 model and OpenCV. It captures webcam video, detects objects frame-by-frame, and displays labeled bounding boxes. Built with Python, Ultralytics YOLOv8, and OpenCV.
This project demonstrates a real-time object detection system using the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) deep learning model, integrated with OpenCV for live webcam feed processing. The goal is to recognize and label objects in a live video stream with high speed and accuracy.

The project utilizes a pre-trained YOLOv8 model, capable of detecting 80+ common object classes (like person, cell phone, book, etc.) from the COCO dataset. The model processes each video frame from the webcam and displays bounding boxes with labels in real time.

This implementation shows how cutting-edge computer vision can be practically applied to real-time environments such as surveillance, retail analytics, robotics, and more.
